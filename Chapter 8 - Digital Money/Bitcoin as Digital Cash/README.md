# List of quotes from Chapter 8 - Digital Money - Bitcoin as Digital Cash

"After years of innovative trial and error by many programmers, and through relying on a wide range of technologies, Bitcoin was the first engineering solution that allowed for digital payments without having to rely to a trusted third-party intermediary." p.170

"By being the first digital object that is verifiably scarce, Bitcoin is the first example of digital cash." p.170

"Sovereign money contains within it all the permission needed to spend it; the desire for others to hold it exceeds the ability of others to impose controls on it." p.170

"Satoshi Nakamoto's motivation for Bitcoin was to create a 'purely peer-to-peer form of electronic cash' that would not require trust in third parties for transactions and whose supply cannot be altered by any other party." p.171

"Nakamoto remove the need for trust in a third party by building Bitcoin on a foundation of very thorough and ironclad proof and verification." p.171

"It is fair to say that the central operational feature of Bitcoin is verification, and only because of that can Bitcoin remove the need for trust completely." p.171

"Whereas in a modern central bank the new money created goes to finance lending and government spending, in Bitcoin the new money goes only to those who spend resources on updating the ledger." p.172

"As more people choose to hold Bitcoin, this drives up the market value of Bitcoin and makes mining new coins more profitable, which drives more miners to expend more resources on solving proof-of-work problems." p.172

"Difficulty adjustment is the most reliable technology for making hard money and limiting the stock-to-flow ratio from rising, and it makes Bitcoin fundamentally different from every other money." p.173

"Whereas the rise in value of any money leads to more resources dedicated to its production and thus an increase in its supply, as Bitcoin's value rises, more effort to produce bitcoins does not lead to the production of more bitcoins." p.173

"Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented: growth in its value cannot possibly increase its supply; it can only make the network more secure and immune to attack." p.173

"Gold became the prime money of every civilized society precisely because it was the hardest to produce, but Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment makes it even harder to produce." p.173

"A massive increase in the price of gold will, in the long run, lead to larger quantities being produced, but no matter how high the price of bitcoins rises, the supply stays the same and the safety of the network only increases." p.173

"The security of Bitcoin lies in the asymmetry between the cost of solving the proof-of-work necessary to commit a transaction to the ledger and the cost of verifying its validity." p.173

"To try to commit fraudulent transactions to the Bitcoin ledger is to deliberately waste resources on solving the proof-of-work only to watch nodes reject it at almost no cost, thereby withholding the block reward from the miner." p.173

"Bitcoin is built on 100% verification and 0% trust." p.174

"What keeps Bitcoin nodes honest, individually, is  that if they were dishonest, they would be discovered immediately, making dishonesty exactly as effective as doing nothing but involving a higher cost." p.175

"No single entity is relied upon for maintaining the ledger and no single individual can alter the record on it without the consent of a majority of network members." p.175

"What determines the validity of the transaction is not the word of a single authority, but the software running the individual nodes on the network." p.175

"Bitcoin is a technology that survives for the very same reason the weheel, knife, phone, or any technology survives: it offers its users benefits from using it." p.176

"Nobody is essential to Bitcoin, and if anybody wants to alter Bitcoin, Bitcoin is perfectly capable of continuing to operate as it is without whatever input anyone has on this." p.176

"Bitcoin can also be understood as a spontaneously emergent and autonomous firm which provides a new form of money and a new payments network. There is no management or corporate structure to this firm, as all decisions are automated and preprogrammed." p.176

"The value proposition of [Bitcoin] is that its money supply is completely inelastic in response to increased demand and supply; instead, increased demand just leads to a safer network due to the mining difficulty adjustment." p.176

"With this technological design, Nakamoto was able to invent digital scarcity. Bitcoin is the first example of a digital good that is scarce and cannot be reproduced infinitely." p.177

"Bitcoin is the first example of a digital good whose transfer stops it from being owned by the sender." p.177

"Beyond digital scarcity, Bitcoin is also the first example of absolute scarcity, the only liquid commodity (digital or physical) with a set fixed quantity that cannot conceivably be increased." p.177
