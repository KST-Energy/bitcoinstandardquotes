# List of quotes from Chapter 9 - What Is Bitcoin Good For? - International and Online Settlement

"The invention of Bitcoin has created, from the ground up, a new independent alternative mechanism for international settlement that does not rely on any intermediary and can operate entirely separate from the existing financial infrastructure." p.205

"The ability of any individual to run a Bitcoin node and send his own money without permission from anyone, and without having to expose his identity, is a noteworthy difference between gold and Bitcoin." p.206

"The very nature of the Bitcoin technology puts governments at a severe disadvantage compared to all other forms of money and thus makes confiscation much harder." p.206

"By virtue of being digital cash, Bitcoin's comparative advantage may not lie in replacing cash payments, but rather in allowing for cash payments to be carried out over long distances." p.207

"Bitcoin can thus be best understood to compete with settlement payments between central banks and large institutions, and it compares favorably to them due to its verifiable record, cryptographic security, and imperviousness to third-party security holes." p.208

"[Bitcoin] is a neutral money for an international system that does not give any one country the 'exorbitant privilege' of issuing the global reserve currency, and is not dependent on its economic performance." p.208

"[...]The finality of settlement on Bitcoin does not rely on any counterparty, and does not require any single bank to be the de facto arbiter, making it ideal for a network of global peers, rather than a global hegemonic centralized order." p.208

"The Bitcoin network is based on a form of money whose supply cannot be inflated by any single member bank, making it a more attractive store-of-value proposition than national currencies whose creation was precisely so their supply could be increased to finance governments." p.208

"If Bitcoin continues to grow in value and gets utilized by a growing number of financial institutions, it will become a currency for a new form of central bank." p.210

"[...]Perhaps the real case for central banks owning bitcoin is as insurance against the scenario of it succeeding." p.211

"As hard as it might be for central bankers to believe it, Bitcoin is a direct competitor to their line of business, which has been closed off from market competition for a century." p.211

"The modern central bank business model is being disrupted. Central banks now have no way of stopping competition by just passing laws as they have always done. They are now up against a digital competitor that most likely cannot be brought under the physical world's laws." p.212

"If the modern world is ancient Rome, suffering the economic consequences of monetary collapse, with the dollar our aureus, then Satoshi Nakamoto is our Constantine, Bitcoin is his solidus, and the internet is our Constantinople." p.212

"Bitcoin serves as a monetary lifeboat for people forced to transact and save in monetary media constantly debased by governments." p.212

"Based on the foregoing analysis, the real advantage of Bitcoin lies in it being a reliable long-term store of value, and a sovereign form of money that allows individuals to conduct permissionless transactions." p.212
