# List of quotes from Chapter 10 - Bitcoin Questions - Altcoins

"After years of watching altcoins get created, it seems impossible that any coin will recreate the adversarial standoff that exists between Bitcoin stakeholders and prevents any party from controlling payments in it." p.251

"Because Nakamoto and Finney are no longer with us, Bitcoin has not had any central authority figure or leader who could dictate its direction or exercise influence over the course of its development." p.252

"[Gavin] Andresen has repeatedly tried to increase the size of Bitcoin's blocks, but all his proposals to do so have failed to gain traction with the operators of the nodes." p.252

"Bitcoin can be understood as a sovereign piece of code, because there is no authority outside of it that can control its behavior. Only Bitcoin's rules control Bitcoin[...]" p.253

"Only Bitcoin's rules control Bitcoin, and the possibility of changing these rules in any substantive way has become extremely impractical as the status-quo bias continues to shape the incentives of everyone involved in the project." p.253

"It is the sovereignty of Bitcoin code, backed by proof-of-work, which makes it a genuinely effective solution to the double-spending problem, and a successful digital cash. And it is this trustlessness which other digital currencies cannot replicate." p.253

"Being fundamentally knock-offs that are very easy to recreate, all altcoins do not have this luxury of real-world demand, and must actively build and increase this demand." p.253

"And as long as there is a party with sovereign power over a digital currency, then that currency cannot be understood as a form of digital cash, but rather, a form of intermediated payment - and a very inefficient one at that." p.254

"[...] there is something deeply and fundamentally wrong about a centralized currency that adopts a highly cumbersome and inefficient design whose only advantage is the removal of a single point of failure." p.254

"If the second largest network in terms of processing power can have its blockchain record altered when the transactions do not go in a way that suits the interests of the development team, then the notion that any of the altcoins is truly regulated by processing power is not tenable." p.255

"The concentration of currency holding, processing power, and programming skills in the hands of one group of people who are effectively partners in a venture defeats the entire purpose of employing a blockchain structure." p.255

"No single altcoin has demonstrated anything near Bitcoin's impressive resilience to change, which is down to its truly decentralized nature and the strong incentives for everyone to abide by the status quo consensus rules." p.255

"In reality, after examining this space for years, I have yet to identify a single digital currency that offers any product or service that has any market demand." p.256

"No coin other than Bitcoin can lay a credible claim to being outside the control of anyone else, and as such, the entire point of utilizing the extremely complex structure underpinning Bitcoin is moot." p.256

"Non-Bitcoin digital currencies are, in the aggregate, easy money." p.257

"The only worthwhile additions to Bitcoin's design were done by the competent selfless  volunteer coders who contributed long hours to making the Bitcoin code better." p.257

"The growth of these altcoins cannot be understood outside the context of easy government money looking for easy investment, forming large bubbles in massive malinvestments." p.257
