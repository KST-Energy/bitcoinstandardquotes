"There is no central authority that determines the evolution of the Bitcoin software and no single programmer is able to dictate any outcome." p.223

"Bitcoin's status quo can be understood as a stable Schelling point, which provides a useful incentive for all participants to stick to it, while the move away from it will always involve a significant risk of loss." p.225

"The coders who develop software to run Bitcoin nodes are powerless to impose changes on anybody; all they can do is propose code, and users are free to download whichever code and version they like." p.227

"[...] it should be clear that Bitcoin's advantages lie not in its speed, convenience, or friendly user experience. Bitcoin's value comes from it having an immutable monetary policy precisely because nobody can easily change it." p. 229

"Bitcoin is straightforward to use, but virtually impossible to alter. Bitcoin is voluntary, so nobody has to use it, but those who want to use it have no choice but to play by its rules." p.230

"Bitcoin is to be taken as it is, accepted on its own terms and used for what it offers." p.230
