# List of quotes from Chapter 10 - Bitcoin Questions - Is Bitcoin Mining a Waste?

"In its essence, proof-of-work involves network members competing to solve mathematical problems that are hard to solve but whose solution is easy to verify." p.218

"By requiring the expenditure of electricity and processing power to produce new bitcoins, PoW is the only method so far discovered for making the production of a digital good reliably expensive, allowing it to be a hard money." p.218

"Bitcoin can thus be understood as a technology that converts electricity to truthful records through the expenditure of processing power." p.219

"By relying entirely on verification, Bitcoin dooms fraudulent transactions to failure and obviates the need for trust in anyone for transactions to be completed." p.219

"By monetizing processing power directly, Bitcoin has become the largest single-purpose computer network in the world." p.220

"A global distributed network of independent dedicated miners now protects the integrity of the Bitcoin ledger. All of these miners have no conceivable purpose but verifying Bitcoin transactions and solving proof-of-work." p.220

"[...]perhaps the real protection of the Bitcoin network at any point in time is that the value of its tokens is entirely dependent on the integrity of the network." p.221

"Being an entirely voluntary system, Bitcoin can only operate if it is honest, as users can very easily leave it otherwise." p.221

"The distribution of the Bitcoin processing power, and the strong resistance of the code to change, combined with the intransigency of the monetary policy, are what has allowed Bitcoin to survive and grow in value to the extent which it has today." p.221

"Bitcoin[...] contains billions of dollars of value, but continues to operate safely and reliably because it was built, from day one, to operate in a highly adversarial setting, subject to relentless attack." p.222
