# List of quotes from Chapter 10 - Bitcoin Questions - Blockchain Technology

"Bitcoin's mechanism for establishing the authenticity and validity of the ledger is extremely complex and complicated, but it serves an explicit purpose: issuing a currency and moving value online without the need for a trusted third party." p.259

"[...] to remove the need for trust, the processing power to run a simple currency and database software needs to be increased roughly by a factor of 2 trillion." p.260

"Trustless digital cash has so far been the only successful implementation for blockchain technology precisely because it is a clean and simple technological process to operate, leading to its ledger growing relatively slowly over time." p.261

"For the first time since the abolition of the gold standard, Bitcoin has made sound money easily available to anyone in the world who wants it." p.261

"[...] Bitcoin is a system built entirely on cumbersome and expensive verification so it can eliminate the need for any trust or accountability between all parties: it is 100% verification and 0% trust." p.262

"The advantages lie in individual sovereignty over the protocol, censorship-resistance, and immutability of the money supply growth and technical parameters." p.262

"[...] the nature of sound money [...] lies precisely in the fact that no human is able to control it, and hence, a predictable immutable algorithm is uniquely suited for this task." p.263

"[...] the colossal processing power needed to make the Bitcoin network operate eliminates the need for a trusted third party to process payments or determine the supply of money. If the third party remains, then all of that processing power is a pointless waste of electricity." p.263

"A non-Bitcoin blockchain combines the worst of both worlds: the cumbersome structure of the blockchain with the cost and security risk of trusted third parties." p.263

"[...] Nakamoto worked anonymously and only communicated curtly via email for about two years. [Bitcoin] did not need investment, venture capital, conferences, or advertisement." p.264

"Bitcoin has a blockchain not because it allows for faster and cheaper transactions, but because it removes the need to trust in third-party intermediation: transactions are cleared because nodes compete to verify them, yet no node needs to be trusted." p.265

"Transactions will clear if valid, and will not clear if not valid, and there is nothing that regulators can do to overturn the consensus of the network processing power." p.269

"[...] Bitcoin grew around the set of established consensus rules through human action, all other projects grew by active human design and management." p.270

"Bitcoin has earned its reputation as being immutable after years of resisting alteration. No other blockchain project can make such a claim." p.270

"Blockchain technology can best be understood as the conversion of electric power to verifiable undisputed records of ownership and transactions." p.271

"An open decentralized system built on verification by processing power is more secure the more open the system and the larger the number of network members expending processing power on verification." p.271
