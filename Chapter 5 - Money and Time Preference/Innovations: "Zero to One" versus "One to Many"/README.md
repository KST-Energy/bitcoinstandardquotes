"The move from having 'zero to one' successful example of a technology [...] is the hardest and most significant step in an invention, whereas the move from 'one to many' is a matter of scaling, marketing, and optimization." p.97

"There is nothing wrong with the move from one to many, but it certainly gives us plenty of food for thought to consider why we do not have many more zero-to-one transformations under our modern monetary system." p.97
