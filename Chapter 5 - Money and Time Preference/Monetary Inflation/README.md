# List of quotes from Chapter 5 - Money and Time Preference - Monetary Inflation

"Any quantity of economic transactions could be supported by a money supply of any size as long as the units are divisible enough." p.81

"With growing wealth and productivity and an increased ability to focus on the future, people begin to reduce their time preference and can focus on improving non-material aspects of their life, including spiritual, social, and cultural endeavours." p.81

"The best form of money in history was the one that would cause the new supply of money to be the least significant compared to the existing stockpiles, and thus make its creation not a good source of profit." p.81

"The folly of Keynes condemning gold as money because its mining is wasteful is that it is the least wasteful of all potential metals to use as money." p.83

"Money, which is held not for its own sake, but for the sake of being exchanged with other goods, will have its utility diminish slower than any other good, because it can always be exchanged for any other good." p.84

"Investment is a reward for taking risk, but sound money, having the least risk, offers no reward." p.84

"It's important to understand that for a monetary medium to remain perfectly constant in value is not even theoretically possible or determinable." p.85

"One of the prime functions of the monetary unit is to serve as the unit of measure for economic goods, whose value is constantly changing." p.85

"Hard money, whose supply cannot be expanded easily, will likely be more stable in value than easy money because its supply is largely inelastic while societal demand for money varies little over time as time preference varies." p.88

"Sound money, chosen on a free market precisely for its likelihood to hold value over time, will naturally have a better stability than unsound money whose use is enforced through government coercion." p.89

"Had government money been a superior unit of account and store of value, it would not need government legal tender laws to enforce it, nor would governments worldwide have had to confiscate large quantities of gold and continue to hold them in their central bank reserves." p.89
