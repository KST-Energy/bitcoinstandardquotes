# List of quotes from Chapter 7 - Sound Money and Individual Freedom - Limited versus Omnipotent Government

"Liberalism triumphed on the principle that the best government is that which governs least; now for all the western nations political wisdom has recast this ideal of liberty into liberality. This shift has thrown the vocabulary into disorder." -Jacques Barzun p.149

"Whereas liberalism held the role of government as allowing individuals to live in liberty and enjoy the benefits, and suffer the consequences, of their actions, liberality was the radical notion that it was government's role to allow individuals to indulge in all their desires while protecting them from the consequences." p.149

"This classical liberal conception of government is only possible in a world with sound money, which acted as a natural restraint against government authoritarianism and overreach." p.150

"In a society of sound money, government is reliant on the consent of its population to finance its operations." p.150

"Sound money, then, enforced a measure of honesty and transparency on governments, restricting their rule to within what was desirable and tolerable to the population." p.150

"Unsound money is a particularly dangerous tool in the hands of modern democratic governments facing constant reelection pressure." p.151

"Democracy thus becomes a mass delusion of people attempting to override the rules of economics by voting themselves a free lunch and being manipulated into violent tantrums against scapegoats whenever the bill for the free lunch arrives via inflation and economic recessions." p.151

"It will shock the average citizen to have the startlingly obvious pointed out to them: all of these nice things you want cannot be summoned costlessly out of thin air by your favorite politician, or his opponent." p.151

"History is replete with examples of how governments that have the prerogative to create money out of thin air have almost always abused this privilege by turning it against their own people." p.152

"It is no coincidence that when recounting the most horrific tyrants of history, one finds that every single one of them operated a system of government-issued money which was constantly inflated to finance government operation." p.152
